                Several years ago NICHOLAS THE JEWELLERS began his wholesale gemstone, gem cutting and gemstone repair business by serving jewelers of europe. These jewelers have come to trust and rely on NICHOLAS THE JEWELLERS to provide quality, wholesale gemstones, as well as to repair irreplaceable gemstones belonging to their valued customers
                </p>
                <p>
                NICHOLAS THE JEWELLERS uses a “Precision Cut” machine that allows him to cut his gemstones at their correct refractive index. Not all gemstones that you see on the market are cut properly (only about 5% are precision cut). A gemstone must be cut at its correct refractive index to reach its potential in brilliance. Also, and importantly, often gemstones that are not cut properly carry additional weight (weight retention), and the customer pays a price for this unnecessary carat weight. With precision-cut gemstones you are getting the best that you can from a gemstone.

                The accent diamonds in our mounts are purchased in the UK and are conflict free determined by the Kimberly Process. Most of the gold in our settings comes from recycled and refined material.
                When customers choose to work with us to create custom pieces that symbolize memorable events in their lives, we truly feel honored. We take that responsibility seriously treating our customers in the way we would wish to be treated.
                Finally, as a bonus, we are proud and regular supporters of the Wilderness Committee:
                We hope to work with you someday!
